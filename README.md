# Cuda Example With Golang

This repo is intended to be a reference for calling cuda code from golang.

Note: It is intended to be as readable as possible. It is not intended to be an example of optimization. 
There's a very good chance that the code in this repo will be slower than normal for most computers. 
When in doubt, benchmark first.

## How To Run Benchmarks

Convenience scripts have been provided for this. Simply run the following

- `./build-cuda.sh`
- `./benchmark.sh`
